Geometric calculations Algorithms visualize with pygame (Two-Dimensional(2D) visualize)
1. Convex Hull (2D point)
2. Orientation of point (direction of point with respect to line i.e. clockwise or anti-clockwise)
3. Line Segment (intersection point & check intersetion point)
4. Minkowski Sum
5. Sweep Line
6. Sutherland-Hodgmann (polygon clipping)
